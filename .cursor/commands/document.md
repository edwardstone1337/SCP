# Update Documentation Task

You are updating documentation after code changes.

## 1. Identify Changes
- Check git diff or recent commits for modified files
- Identify which features/modules were changed
- Note any new files, deleted files, or renamed files

## 2. Verify Current Implementation
**CRITICAL**: DO NOT trust existing documentation. Read the actual code.

For each changed file:
- Read the current implementation
- Understand actual behavior (not documented behavior)
- Note any discrepancies with existing docs

## 3. Update Relevant Documentation

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Add entry under "Unreleased" section
  - Use categories: Added, Changed, Fixed, Security, Removed
  - Be concise, user-facing language

  - **SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md**: Update any sections affected by the changes
  - Route table, file structure tree, database schema, component library table, auth flow, security notes
  - Only update sections that are actually affected — don't rewrite unrelated sections
  - If a file was added, deleted, or renamed, reflect it in the file structure
  - If a route was added or removed, update the route table


## 4. Documentation Style Rules

✅ **Concise** - Sacrifice grammar for brevity
✅ **Practical** - Examples over theory
✅ **Accurate** - Code verified, not assumed
✅ **Current** - Matches actual implementation

❌ No enterprise fluff
❌ No outdated information
❌ No assumptions without verification

## 5. Ask if Uncertain

If you're unsure about intent behind a change or user-facing impact, **ask the user** - don't guess.
